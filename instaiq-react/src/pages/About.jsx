            </div>
            <p>
              <strong>The Story</strong> began as a passionate vision in the heart of <em>Amit Aswale</em>, a former defense aspirant turned corporate professional and now a dynamic educator. With firsthand experience of the gap between academic learning and employability skills, Amit recognized a pressing need — students across India were completing degrees without gaining the real-world aptitude, communication, and confidence needed for careers.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2016, during interactions with college students, Amit noticed a recurring theme: <strong>brilliant minds were underprepared for placements, not due to lack of intelligence, but due to lack of direction, exposure, and soft skill training.</strong> That’s when the seed of INSTA IQ was sown — a platform that would go beyond traditional teaching and focus on <strong>real-time skilling, placement readiness, and confidence building</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a deep understanding of both <strong>aptitude training</strong> and the <strong>corporate hiring process</strong>, INSTA IQ was launched. Starting with just a few colleges, the brand quickly gained recognition for its <strong>hands-on training modules, industry-relevant curriculum, and outcome-focused delivery</strong>.
